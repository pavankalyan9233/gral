 + Test pagerank
 + Remember loaded fields in graph, change setup of column store
 + Graph ids integers (API change)
 + job ids integers (API change)
 - why does it take 3 seconds to load small graph?
 - Write results pagerank
 - Implement irank
 - Test irank
 - write results irank
 - implement label propagation
 - test label propagation
 - write results label propagation
 - write results combined?
 - Fix APIs without user, e.g. graphs
 - Bearer and bearer 
 - more generic error handling via handle_errors
 - remove stuff from grupload or implement HTTP upload
 - use only HTTP/JSON API in grupload
 - add first metrics: number of graphs, number of computations, memory usage
 - better progress tracking in jobs
 - interrupt jobs
 - Generalize write back of computation result to components computation
 - create target collection
 - job cancellation for load
 - Metrics for ArangoDB import and export
 - AQL query load (for subgraph import)
 - use projections
 - subgraph import via dump endpoint
 - Progress report on load of vertices and edges
 - Progress report on writeback of results
 - direct randomize/upload
 - Extend end to end test
 - coverage?
 - Tune randomize (parallelization)
