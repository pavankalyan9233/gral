 - display memory usage per graph and per computation via API
 - add first metrics: number of graphs, number of computations, memory usage
 - CI integration (CircleCI? github actions?)
 - Add integration test with ArangoDB and service
 - documentation of API
 - example usage in documentation

 - benchmark against Neo4j?
 - more tests
 - better progress tracking in compute jobs
 - Progress report on load of vertices and edges
 - Progress report on writeback of results
 - interrupt jobs
 - create target collection if not already there
 - Metrics for ArangoDB import and export
 - AQL query load (for subgraph import)
 - job cancellation for load
 - use projections in 3.12
 - subgraph import via dump endpoint
 - direct randomize/upload to quickly make random graphs
 - why does it take 3 seconds to load small graph?

 - more algorithms
