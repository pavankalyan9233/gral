 - report total, progress and error with jobs
 - bad 405 response if graph or job not found?
 - bad binary responses when errors in JSON methods
 - remove unneeded binary protocol stuff (only push and get results stay binary)
 - move binary protocol to separate file
 - move error handling to separate module, adjust for JSON most of the time
 - Fetch JSON data on graph load, store as vector of serde::json
 - Give the `compute` API a way to specify a previous job
 - Implement an aggregation job with different result set
 - job cancellation for load
 - check if grupload still works with binary protocol
 - change grupload to use JSON API where performance does not matter,,
 - remove binary API where not necessary?
 - put fetching graph into background, report as job
 - Write result back into collection in ArangoDB
 - Refactor (error handling in module, etc.)
 - Add metrics (rust-prometheus crate)
 - Metrics for ArangoDB import and export
 - metric about memory usage
 - AQL query upload (for subgraph import)
 - use projections
 - subgraph import?
 - Progress report on upload of vertices and edges
 - Progress report on download of results
 - direct randomize/upload
 - Implement graph dump
 - Extend end to end test
 - coverage?
 - Tune randomize (parallelization)
 - Tune receive in gral
 - error handling for server responses in client
 - proper logging
